<h1 class="text-danger">How to win the Aviator casino game </h1>
<p class="text-center text-primary">
It’s worth going over the basics of the Aviator crash game before we get too deep into the various tips, strategies, hacks and cheats. We’ve got our Aviator game review here but it’s enough to know that this is a casino game that was released by the Ukrainian developer, Spribe, in 2019.

Aviator looks and plays like most Crash games, the main differences being that:

You’ll see an aeroplane rather than a rocket
The aeroplane flies off the edge of the screen rather than exploding.
To play Aviator you just need to make a prediction about how far the aeroplane will fly before it flies off. You’ll be betting on a particular multiplier, and if the aeroplane goes past that multiplier, you’ll win back your stake multiplied by the multiplier.

If the aeroplane doesn’t make it that far, you’ll lose your bet and your stake. It sounds simple enough, and it is, but many punters opt to incorporate an Aviator gambling strategy in order to give themselves the best chance of success.

Aviator casino game tricks
While the Aviator betting game is a lot of fun to play, it’s not always easy to win. This is because all of the results are completely random and therefore you’ll have a tricky time predicting how far the aeroplane will reach. Because of this, no Aviator game winning strategy guarantees results – it merely assists in your gameplay as you look to walk away with a profit.

Because people like to bet real money on Aviator, that’s obviously a big incentive to win more often when they play this game. All of this means that there’s a never-ending search for tricks, cheats and hacks that can be used to beat Aviator.

Key components of the best Aviator gambling strategy
Any good Spribe Aviator strategy isn’t going to be made up of a single quick trick. Instead, you’ll need plenty of patience, a good understanding of the game, and the following ingredients:

1. Bankroll management
All seasoned gamblers know to set themselves a budget and stick to it, this is the essence of bankroll management.
This enables them to encounter the occasional loss and not have it wipe out their bankroll completely.
Such a tactic is essential for playing Aviator because the chances are that you’ll lose your bets sooner or later.
The good news is that all decent online casinos give you easy ways to apply limits to your losses and wagering so that you can enjoy a more controlled way to bet on Aviator.

2. Bet on low multipliers
If you’ve tried an Aviator game demo you’d know that you’ll win far more bets on Aviator if you only bet on the lower multipliers.
This is because there is a far higher chance of the aeroplane making it past a multiplier of 1.50x compared to 15x.
Obviously, you won’t get to make such spectacular wins compared to the higher multipliers, but some wins are better than making no wins at all.
Slow and steady wins the race and this is definitely true when it comes to playing a crypto casino game like Aviator.
3. Try making two bets
One unique feature of Aviator is the fact that it allows you to make two bets at once.
This gives you an interesting way to try and balance out two contrasting bet types.
For example, you could keep things safe by betting on a multiplier of 1.50, and then add an element of risk by betting on a multiplier of 5.00.
This way, you’ll be partially covered if the aeroplane doesn’t make it too far, and you’ll also have a hand in getting a substantial return should the aeroplane make it to the higher multipliers.

4. Don’t follow the crowd
Many people like to play Aviator because it has a cool social element.
This allows you to chat with other players and see what kinds of multipliers they are betting on.
While this is entertaining, it shouldn’t be a guide for your own gameplay.
This is especially so when it comes to casino games as there can be something of a herd mentality as gamers tend to boast about the massive wins that they’ve enjoyed.
Our advice is to only use the social features of Aviator merely as a source of entertainment rather than being a way of predicting what the next result will be.
5. Understand the RTP
It’s important to note that Aviator has a fixed return to player (RTP) percentage of 97%.
This means that for every $100 that you wager on Aviator, you could expect to win back $97 on average over time.
As a result, you’ll see that the odds are slightly tilted in the casino site’s favour when you play this game.
Such an RTP is in place to ensure that the casino can afford to stay in business and keep offering you a chance to play Aviator.
As long as you recognise the fact that you’re going to experience lots of losses when you play Aviator, it shouldn’t dent your enjoyment too much.
6. Choose the right Casino
When choosing where to play the Aviator game, prioritize safety, legitimacy, and attractive bonuses.
Look for reputable casinos that are licensed and regulated, ensuring a secure gaming experience.
Opt for platforms with positive player reviews and a solid reputation. By considering these factors, you can find a trustworthy casino to enjoy the game.
Be careful of ‘expert’ tricks to win the Aviator game
If you Google phrases like ‘Aviator game tricks’, then the chances are that you’ll stumble across all manner of weird and wonderful gambling systems. These have exotic names like the Labouchere system and the d’Alembert system, but they aren’t worth bothering with. After all, if these systems worked then everyone using them would be rich.

This definitely isn’t the case with the Martingale system. Here you are supposed to double your stake in every losing bet in the belief that by the time you land a winning bet, your increased stake will be big enough to cover all of your prior losses.

However, because Aviator uses a random number generator, there is no guarantee that this massive win will ever materialise. This means that there’s every chance that you’d blown your bankroll before you’d ever made a win.  More generally, there is no guaranteed Aviator game winning strategy, so if you notice that you are making losses then stop playing and do not risk any more money.

Are there any Aviator game cheats?
Everything from the top Aviator casino site to the best Aviator game app will make sure that their gaming platforms are completely encrypted. This means that you’ll have little chance of getting past the SSL-level encryption to cheat the results of Aviator.

It’s also worth noting that the results of Aviator use a special kind of cryptographic hashing to make sure that they are unpredictable and fair. It works by combining a publicly viewable 16-digit server seed with a client seed to ensure that the results of each round are unpredictable and completely independent of the previous round.

Best time to play Aviator
Spend any time researching casino games online and you will quickly realise that there is all manner of misinformation when it comes to tips on beating any game – including Aviator. One such myth is that by playing a game at a certain time – such as after many players have lost consecutively – will increase your likelihood of success. This is completely untrue and every game of Aviator is a unique event, so you are better off considering the RTP (97%) when working out your chances of a win.

Why you won’t need an Aviator game hack
Some players spend their time thinking about hacking the Aviator game, but it doesn’t matter whether you’re playing the Aviator game in India, Canada, the UK or anywhere else in the world as it should be all about entertainment. This means that you shouldn’t waste your time hunting down more elaborate tips and tricks to beat Aviator. Just concentrate on your gameplay and enjoy one of the most remarkable casino games of recent years.

Aviator signals
Another online myth is that there are certain Aviator game patterns or a signal that may give you a clue as to whether your bet will be a success in the next round. This is not true, and would not be allowed at any licensed casino.

Aviator game tricks: The verdict
We’ve shown you some great Aviator game tricks to get you started, but the truth is that there’s always something new to learn about if you want to know how to beat the Aviator game.

FAQs
What is the best way to play Aviator?

How do you get more money from Aviator?
To make money from Aviator, you need to concentrate on making those bets that give you a better chance of winning. Obviously, you should remember to always gamble responsibly when you play Aviator as the chances are that you will lose sooner or later.
What is the perfect time to play Aviator?
